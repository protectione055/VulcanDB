**Description:**

A two story, duplex apartment building. In addition to the architectural model, discipline-specific models are created to simulate what might be created by engineering consultants on a much larger project. 

How can you best use this information?

This is a widely known "Hello World" example for those  learning to navigate Coordination MVD Files in STEP Physical File Format (SPFF).

How did we use this information?

These files were used as the first common test models demonstrating the ability of "overloaded" Coordination MVD SPFF files to deliver COBie 2.26 data. This extraction was accomplished using the COBie Plugin for BIMserver, published by TNO. 

Where did this information come from?

The Duplex Apartment project was first published in Germany and provided to the US Construction Engineering Research Laboratory. These files were hosted by the US National Institute of Building Sciences from 2009 thru 2020, but were taken down without notice and so have been provided through the BSI repository.
